Usage
=====================

.. code-block:: python

   dp_loss = DemographicParityLoss(sensitive_classes=[0, 1], alpha=100)
   criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

   .
   .
   .  

   logit = model(x_train)
   loss = criterion(logit.view(-1), y_train)
   loss = loss + dp_loss(x_train, logit, sensitive_features)

Background
=====================
In recent years, machine learning-based algorithms and softwares have rapidly spread in society. However, cases have been found where these algorithms unintentionally suggest discriminatory decisions[1]. For example, allocation harms can occur when AI systems extend or withhold opportunities, resources, or information. Some of the key applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending[2]. Since Pytorch didn't have a library to achieve fairness yet, we decided to create one.

=====================
What it does
=====================
Fairtorch provides tools to mitigate inequities in classification and regression. Classification is only available in binary classification. A unique feature of this tool is that you can add a fairness constraint to your model by simply adding a few lines of code.

========================
Challenges we ran into
========================
In the beginning, we attempted to develop 'FairTorch'_ based on the Fairlearn[3]â€™s reduction algorithm. However, it was implemented based on scikit-learn and was not a suitable algorithm for deep learning. It requires ensemble training of the model, which would be too computationally expensive to be used for deep learning. To solve that problem, we implemented a constrained optimization without ensemble learning to fit the existing Fairlearn algorithm for deep learning.
